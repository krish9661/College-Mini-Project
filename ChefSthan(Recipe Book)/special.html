              <h3>Kanda Poha</h3>
              <img src="./CSS/Poha-recipe-750x536.jpg" alt="" />

              <p>
                <strong> Poha Recipe Ingredients :-</strong>
                <li>
                  Poha: I prefer Medium or Thick poha to make this recipe. When
                  rinsed, it gets fluffy and absorbent. It is easily available
                  in Indian grocery stores. The thin poha doesn't work for this
                  recipe, as it turns mushy when rinsed. You may also use red or
                  brown rice poha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Onion: I used finely chopped red onion. You can also use
                  yellow or white onions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Potatoes: I used one medium Yukon gold potato. However, you
                  can make this poha without potatoes as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spices: a tempering (tadka) made using mustard seeds, cumin
                  seeds (jeera), curry leaves, and green chilies. I use turmeric
                  powder for color and flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Peanuts: You can add peanuts for the crunch. Oil: You can use
                  any cooking oil.
                </li>
                <br />
                <strong>Procedure :- </strong>
                <li>
                  Gently rinse poha in a colander under running water 2-3 times
                  until they soften, and then drain out all the water. When you
                  press with your fingers, it should break easily. Keep it
                  aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat oil in a Kadai. Add raw peanuts and fry until they turn
                  golden brown. Remove the peanuts to a plate and set them
                  aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the same kadai, add mustard and cumin seeds and let them
                  splutter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then, add green chilies, curry leaves, and chopped onion.
                  Saute until onions turn soft and translucent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next, add cubed potatoes (or mixed vegetables) and cook for
                  2-3 minutes. To make simple plain pohe, you can skip adding
                  potatoes or veggies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cover and cook on medium-low heat till the potatoes are soft
                  and perfectly cooked. Sprinkle some water if required. (You
                  can also use pre-boiled cubed potatoes and saute for 2
                  minutes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add rinsed and drained poha, turmeric, salt, and sugar. Mix
                  everything well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you feel the pohe is too dry, sprinkle some water. Cover it
                  with a lid and cook for 2 minutes on low heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Turn off the heat. Add the lemon juice and roasted peanuts,
                  and give a quick mix. Lastly, garnish with coriander leaves.
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Serve hot with Masala chai or Coffee</strong>

              <h3>Butter Paneer Masala</h3>
              <img src="./CSS/Butter-Chicken.jpg" alt="" />
              <p>
                <strong>Butter Paneer Masala Ingredients :- </strong>
                <li>
                  Ripe, red & juicy tomatoes: Tomatoes are a key ingredient here
                  and form the base of the makhani sauce. As such, it is
                  important to choose good, ripe tomatoes that are sweet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Raw Cashews: Yet another important ingredient for the gravy is
                  cashews. The nuts impart a lovely creaminess and sheen in the
                  dish, and the sweetness of the cashews help to balance the
                  tanginess of the tomatoes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cream: In addition to using cashew paste, this Butter Paneer
                  recipe calls for cream to help thicken the sauce and add
                  richness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Butter: The amount of butter that is added is just right in
                  this paneer butter masala recipe. Butter makes the curry
                  luxurious and, well… buttery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Paneer: The quality of your paneer can make or break your
                  dish. What you want are succulent, soft paneer cubes gently
                  coated with a smooth, buttery tomato sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spices & Herbs: One reason this recipe is so great for
                  weeknights is that the list of herbs and spices isn’t
                  intimidatingly long. For that brilliant orange color, you need
                  to add Kashmiri red chilli powder.
                </li>
                <br />
                <strong>Procedure :- </strong>
                <li>
                  Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil
                  is hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves and saute for
                  few seconds.Then add the the onion, garlic, ginger and saute
                  for 2 to 3 minutes until the onion is translucent.
                </li>
                <li>Add the tomatoes and cashews and mix.</li>
                <li>Then add 1 cup of water.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan and cook on medium heat for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>
                  After 15 minutes, remove the pan from heat. Remove the bay
                  leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let the mixture cool down a bit and then transfer to a
                  blender. It’s important to let it cool down a bit else it will
                  all blow up from the mixer.
                </li>
                <li>Grind the masala to a smooth paste and set aside.</li>
                <li>Grind the masala to a smooth paste and set aside.</li>
                <li>
                  Once the butter melts, add the red chili powder and the
                  Kashmiri red chili powder and fry for few seconds. This will
                  give the curry a nice red color.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then add the ground paste back into the pan along with the
                  garam masala (start with 1/2 teaspoon and add the remaining
                  1/4 teaspoon at the end only if you feel like the curry needs
                  that extra bit of garam masala), cardamom powder, sugar, salt
                  and tomato paste (if using).
                </li>
                <li>Then add the cream and mix</li>
                <li>
                  Add in the paneer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat.
                  Finally add crushed kasuri methi.
                </li>

                <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon amchur (dried mango powder)</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
                <strong>Instructions:</strong>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix all-purpose flour,
                  ajwain, salt, and 4 tablespoons of oil. Rub the oil into the
                  flour for about 3-4 minutes until well incorporated. Gradually
                  add water and knead to form a smooth dough. Cover and let it
                  rest for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> Boil, peel, and mash the
                  potatoes. Heat oil in a pan, add cumin seeds, fennel seeds,
                  crushed coriander seeds, ginger, green chili, and hing. Add
                  green peas and cook for a few minutes. Mix in the mashed
                  potatoes, coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, red chili

                  <strong> Assemble the Samosas:</strong> Divide the dough into
                  small balls. Roll out each ball into a thin circle. Cut the
                  circle in half to form two semi-circles. Fold each semi-circle
                  into a cone shape, sealing the edges with water. Fill the cone
                  with the potato mixture. Seal the top by pressing the edges
                  together.
                </li>

                  Remove and drain on paper towels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Serve Hot: </strong>Serve your homemade samosas with
                  mint chutney or tamarind chutney. Enjoy the flaky goodness!

                <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
                <li>1-inch cinnamon piece</li>
                <li>
                  2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)
